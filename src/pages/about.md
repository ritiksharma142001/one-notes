# About es-notes

This website is built using Nextra documentation, and its primary objective is to provide a comprehensive range of documentation on various technologies. 

As I am learning multiple technologies simultaneously, I continuously update the documentation to ensure clarity and simplicity in understanding the fundamental concepts. The aim is to offer clear explanations and assist with concept clarification during preparation.

I hope many people will join this journey to help make these concepts more accessible to everyone. I kindly request that each individual contribute by resolving conflicts and providing the easiest way to understand complex topics.

Together, we can simplify learning and ensure that everyone can easily grasp and apply new concepts.

While there are many updates coming for Nextra, I am sticking to this version for the time being. However, if anyone wishes to shift to the latest or stable version, feel free to do so at your convenience.
