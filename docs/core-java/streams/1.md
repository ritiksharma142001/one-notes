# Java 8 Stream API – Basics

Java 8 introduced a powerful feature called **Stream API**, found in the package:

```java
import java.util.stream.*;
```

## What is a Stream?

A Stream is a sequence of elements that supports **functional-style operations** to process data. It works primarily with collections like `List`, `Set`, etc.

Think of a stream as a **conveyor belt** that allows you to:

* Filter
* Transform
* Collect
* Iterate
* Convert data

## Why Use Streams?

* Removes the need for manual loops
* Efficient and readable
* Helps write clean and declarative code
* Supports parallel processing

## Key Difference

| Concept    | Purpose                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Collection | Used to **store** a group of objects |
| Stream     | Used to **process** those objects    |

## How to Create a Stream

You can create a stream from a collection like this:

```java
Stream<T> s = collection.stream();
```

* `collection` is any `List`, `Set`, etc.
* `.stream()` creates a Stream object

## Prerequisites

Before learning Streams, you should be familiar with:

* Lambda expressions
* Method references
* Optional class (introduced in Java 8)

## Components of a Stream

### 1. Sequence of Elements

* A stream works with a sequence of data (like items in a list)

### 2. Source

* The source can be a collection, array, or I/O channel

### 3. Aggregate Operations

* Operations like `filter()`, `map()`, `collect()`, etc.

### 4. Pipelining

* Multiple operations can be chained together (like filters and maps)

### 5. Internal Iteration

* Stream handles looping internally, unlike traditional `for` loops

## Important Notes

* Streams belong to the package: `java.util.stream`
* They do **not** store data; they only **process** it
* They support **lazy evaluation** — operations are only performed when necessary
