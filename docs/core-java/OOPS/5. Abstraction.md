### **Abstraction in Java**

#### **1. What is Abstraction?**
Abstraction is the process of hiding irrelevant details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It can be achieved using **abstract classes** or **interfaces**.

#### **2. Key Points About Abstraction**
- The `abstract` keyword is used to declare an **abstract class** and **abstract methods**.
- An **abstract method** is a method that does not have a body; it must be implemented by subclasses.
- If a class contains at least one abstract method, it must be declared as an **abstract class**.

#### **3. Example of Abstraction in Java**

```java
// Abstract class Teacher
abstract class Teacher {
    // Abstract methods (no body)
    abstract void teach();
    abstract void project();
}

// JavaTeacher class extending Teacher
class JavaTeacher extends Teacher {
    @Override
    void teach() {
        System.out.println("Teaching Java programming");
    }
    
    @Override
    void project() {
        System.out.println("Guiding Java project");
    }
}

// PythonTeacher class implementing Teacher
class PythonTeacher extends Teacher {
    @Override
    void teach() {
        System.out.println("Teaching Python programming");
    }
    
    @Override
    void project() {
        System.out.println("Guiding Python project");
    }
}

// Main class - TeacherApp
public class TeacherApp {
    // Static method to demonstrate teacher behavior
    static void teacherBehavior(Teacher teacher) {
        teacher.teach();
        teacher.project();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating objects of JavaTeacher and PythonTeacher
        Teacher javaTeacher = new JavaTeacher();
        Teacher pythonTeacher = new PythonTeacher();
        
        // Calling static method with different teacher types
        teacherBehavior(javaTeacher);
        teacherBehavior(pythonTeacher);
    }
}
```

#### **4. Explanation of the Code**
- **Abstract Class `Teacher`**: Defines abstract methods `teach()` and `project()`, which must be implemented by subclasses.
- **Concrete Classes `JavaTeacher` and `PythonTeacher`**: Extend `Teacher` and provide implementations for `teach()` and `project()`.
- **Static Method `teacherBehavior()`**: Accepts a `Teacher` object and calls its methods, demonstrating polymorphism.
- **Main Method Execution**:
  1. Creates instances of `JavaTeacher` and `PythonTeacher`.
  2. Calls `teacherBehavior()` to execute their methods.

#### **5. Key Takeaways**
- **Abstraction** helps in designing flexible and reusable code.
- **Abstract classes** allow defining common functionality while forcing subclasses to implement specific behaviors.
- **Static methods** can be used to handle different object types polymorphically.
- **Abstraction reduces code complexity by exposing only relevant details.**


### **Pure and Impure Abstract Classes in Java**

#### **1. What is an Abstract Class?**
An **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain **abstract methods** (methods without a body) as well as **concrete methods** (methods with a body).

#### **2. Types of Abstract Classes**

##### **(A) Pure Abstract Class**
A **pure abstract class** is an abstract class where **all methods are abstract** (i.e., have no body).

```java
// Pure Abstract Class
abstract class Program1 {
    abstract void display1();
    abstract void display2();
}
```

##### **(B) Impure Abstract Class (Type 1)**
An **impure abstract class** is an abstract class that contains **at least one abstract method and at least one concrete method**.

```java
// Impure Abstract Class with one abstract and one concrete method
abstract class Program2 {
    abstract void display1(); // Abstract method
    
    void display2() { // Concrete method
        System.out.println("Inside concrete method display2()");
    }
}
```

##### **(C) Impure Abstract Class (Type 2)**
Another type of impure abstract class where **both methods are concrete** but the class is still abstract.

```java
// Impure Abstract Class with all concrete methods
abstract class Program3 {
    void display1() {
        System.out.println("Inside concrete method display1()");
    }
    
    void display2() {
        System.out.println("Inside concrete method display2()");
    }
}
```

#### **3. Why Can't Abstract Classes Be Instantiated?**
- An **abstract class is incomplete** because it may have abstract methods that do not have an implementation.
- If an object is created for an abstract class, it would not be able to call abstract methods as they have no body.
- Instead, **abstract classes must be inherited by a subclass**, which provides implementations for abstract methods.

#### **4. Example Demonstrating Instantiation Restriction**

```java
abstract class Example {
    abstract void show(); // Abstract method
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example obj = new Example(); // Error! Abstract classes cannot be instantiated
    }
}
```

#### **5. Key Takeaways**
- **A pure abstract class** has only abstract methods.
- **An impure abstract class** has a mix of abstract and concrete methods.
- **Abstract classes cannot be instantiated** but can be used as a base class for inheritance.
- **Subclasses must implement abstract methods** before they can be instantiated.
- **Concrete methods in an abstract class provide shared functionality** without requiring every subclass to implement them.


### **Partial Abstraction in Java**

#### **1. What is Partial Abstraction?**
- If a child class **inherits** an abstract class that contains abstract methods, the child class **must override all abstract methods**.
- If the child class does **not** provide implementations for all abstract methods, it must be declared **abstract** as well.
- A **partially abstract class** is an abstract class that implements some but not all of its abstract methods.

#### **2. Example of Partial Abstraction**

```java
// Abstract class Vehicle
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void speed();  // Abstract method
    abstract void seater(); // Abstract method
}

// Abstract class Car extending Vehicle (Partial Abstraction)
abstract class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void speed() { // Implementing only speed method
        System.out.println("Car has a speed limit of 200 km/h");
    }
    // 'seater()' is not implemented, so Car remains abstract
}

// Concrete class Bike extending Vehicle (Full Implementation)
class Bike extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void speed() {
        System.out.println("Bike has a speed limit of 150 km/h");
    }
    
    @Override
    void seater() {
        System.out.println("Bike is a 2-seater");
    }
}

// Main class
public class VehicleApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle(); // Error! Abstract classes cannot be instantiated
        // Car car = new Car(); // Error! Abstract classes cannot be instantiated
        
        Bike bike = new Bike(); // Creating an instance of Bike
        bike.speed();  // Calls speed method
        bike.seater(); // Calls seater method
    }
}
```

#### **3. Explanation of the Code**
- **Abstract Class `Vehicle`**: Contains two abstract methods `speed()` and `seater()`.
- **Partial Abstract Class `Car`**: Implements only the `speed()` method but not `seater()`, so it remains abstract.
- **Concrete Class `Bike`**: Implements both `speed()` and `seater()`, making it a complete class.
- **Instantiation Rules**:
  - **Abstract classes cannot be instantiated** (`new Vehicle()` and `new Car()` would cause errors).
  - **Concrete classes must implement all abstract methods** before they can be instantiated.

#### **4. Key Takeaways**
- **Partial abstraction allows abstract classes to provide some implementations while leaving others for subclasses.**
- **If a child class does not implement all abstract methods, it must also be declared abstract.**
- **Concrete subclasses must provide implementations for all inherited abstract methods.**
- **Abstract classes help in designing a flexible and reusable object-oriented structure.**


### **Restrictions on Abstract Methods in Java**

#### **1. Why Can't Abstract Methods Be `final` or `static`?**

##### **(A) Abstract Methods Cannot Be `final`**
- An **abstract method** must be **overridden** by a subclass to provide its implementation.
- A **`final` method cannot be overridden**, which contradicts the purpose of an abstract method.
- **Opposing Statements**:
  - Abstract methods **must be overridden**.
  - Final methods **cannot be overridden**.
- This conflict makes it **impossible** to declare an abstract method as `final`.

##### **(B) Abstract Methods Cannot Be `static`**
- A **static method belongs to a class**, not an instance.
- **Abstract methods are meant to be implemented in subclasses**, but a `static` method cannot be overridden.
- This means declaring an abstract method as `static` contradicts its purpose.

#### **2. Example Demonstrating Errors**

```java
// Abstract class Vehicle
abstract class Vehicle {
    // Valid final method (Concrete method in abstract class)
    final void speed() {
        System.out.println("Speed limit is 100 km/h");
    }
    
    // Invalid: Abstract methods cannot be final
    // abstract final void seater(); // ERROR
    
    // Invalid: Abstract methods cannot be static
    // abstract static void typeEngine(); // ERROR
}
```

#### **3. Explanation of Errors**
- `final` method **`speed()`** is valid because it has a body and cannot be overridden.
- `abstract final void seater();` **causes an error** because abstract methods must be overridden, but final methods cannot be.
- `abstract static void typeEngine();` **causes an error** because static methods belong to a class and cannot be overridden.

#### **4. Key Takeaways**
- **Abstract methods cannot be `final`** because they must be overridden.
- **Abstract methods cannot be `static`** because static methods belong to the class and cannot be overridden.
- **Abstract classes can contain `final` or `static` concrete methods**, but not abstract ones.
- **Using abstract methods correctly ensures proper inheritance and polymorphism in Java.**


### **Understanding Static and Non-Static Members in an Abstract Class**

#### **1. Components of an Abstract Class**
An abstract class in Java can contain:
- **Static variables**: Shared among all instances of the class.
- **Static methods**: Can be called without creating an object.
- **Static blocks**: Executed once when the class is loaded.
- **Non-static (instance) variables**: Belong to an instance of the class.
- **Non-static blocks**: Execute when an object is created, before the constructor.
- **Constructors**: Used to initialize instance variables.
- **Abstract methods**: Must be implemented by subclasses.

#### **2. Example of an Abstract Class with Static and Non-Static Members**

```java
// Abstract class Vehicle
abstract class Vehicle {
    static int x; // Static variable
    int y; // Non-static variable
    
    // Static block (Executes when class loads)
    static {
        System.out.println("Inside static block");
        x = 10;
    }
    
    // Static method (Can be called without an object)
    static void display1() {
        System.out.println("Inside static method display1()");
        System.out.println("Value of x: " + x);
    }
    
    // Non-static block (Executes before constructor when an object is created)
    {
        System.out.println("Inside non-static block");
        y = 20;
    }
    
    // Constructor
    Vehicle() {
        System.out.println("Inside Vehicle constructor");
    }
    
    // Non-static method
    void display2() {
        System.out.println("Inside non-static method display2()");
        System.out.println("Value of x: " + x);
        System.out.println("Value of y: " + y);
    }
    
    // Abstract method (Must be implemented by subclasses)
    abstract void display3();
}
```

#### **3. Explanation of the Code**
- **Static Variable `x`**: Initialized in the static block and shared across all objects.
- **Static Block**: Executes once when the class is loaded.
- **Static Method `display1()`**: Prints the value of `x` and can be called without an object.
- **Non-static Variable `y`**: Initialized in the non-static block.
- **Non-static Block**: Runs when an object is created, before the constructor.
- **Constructor**: Runs when an object is instantiated.
- **Non-static Method `display2()`**: Prints values of `x` and `y`.
- **Abstract Method `display3()`**: Must be implemented by a subclass.

#### **4. Key Takeaways**
- **Static members belong to the class**, whereas **non-static members belong to instances**.
- **Static blocks execute once when the class is loaded**.
- **Non-static blocks execute before the constructor when an object is created**.
- **Abstract methods must be implemented in subclasses**.
- **Static methods cannot access non-static variables directly**.
- **Static methods can be called without an instance, but non-static methods require an object**.

This structure ensures better understanding and organization of Java classes containing static and non-static members.


### **Abstraction Using Interfaces in Java**

#### **1. What is an Interface?**
- An **interface** consists only of **abstract methods** (prior to Java 8).
- It is another way of achieving **abstraction** in Java.
- A class that implements an interface must provide implementations for all abstract methods **or** be declared abstract.
- **`implements` keyword** is used by a class to inherit an interface.

#### **2. Example of Abstraction Using an Interface**

```java
// Interface defining student activities
interface StudentActivities {
    void study();    // Abstract method
    void practice(); // Abstract method
}

// Class implementing StudentActivities interface for Physics student
class PhysicsStudent implements StudentActivities {
    @Override
    public void study() {
        System.out.println("Physics student is studying Physics concepts.");
    }
    
    @Override
    public void practice() {
        System.out.println("Physics student is solving numerical problems.");
    }
}

// Class implementing StudentActivities interface for Math student
class MathStudent implements StudentActivities {
    @Override
    public void study() {
        System.out.println("Math student is studying algebra and calculus.");
    }
    
    @Override
    public void practice() {
        System.out.println("Math student is solving equations and proofs.");
    }
}

// Main class with static method to invoke student activities
public class StudentApp {
    static void invokeStudentActivity(StudentActivities student) {
        student.study();
        student.practice();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PhysicsStudent physicsStudent = new PhysicsStudent();
        MathStudent mathStudent = new MathStudent();
        
        System.out.println("Physics Student Activities:");
        invokeStudentActivity(physicsStudent);
        
        System.out.println("\nMath Student Activities:");
        invokeStudentActivity(mathStudent);
    }
}
```

#### **3. Explanation of the Code**
- **Interface `StudentActivities`**:
  - Declares two abstract methods: `study()` and `practice()`.
- **Class `PhysicsStudent`**:
  - Implements the `StudentActivities` interface.
  - Provides concrete implementations for `study()` and `practice()`.
- **Class `MathStudent`**:
  - Implements the `StudentActivities` interface.
  - Provides concrete implementations for `study()` and `practice()`.
- **Static Method `invokeStudentActivity(StudentActivities student)`**:
  - Calls `study()` and `practice()` on any object that implements `StudentActivities`.
- **Main Method**:
  - Creates instances of `PhysicsStudent` and `MathStudent`.
  - Calls `invokeStudentActivity()` for both students.

#### **4. Key Takeaways**
- **Interfaces in Java help achieve abstraction** by enforcing method implementation.
- **A class implementing an interface must provide method bodies for all abstract methods.**
- **Interfaces promote loose coupling** and enable multiple inheritance.
- **Static methods in a separate class can be used to invoke interface methods dynamically.**


### **Why Were Interfaces Introduced in Java?**

#### **1. Reasons for Introducing Interfaces**
- **Standardization**: Interfaces provide method declarations only, ensuring that implementing classes follow a standard structure. Interfaces specify **what to do**, not **how to do it**.
- **Multiple Inheritance**: Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes, but **multiple inheritance can be achieved using interfaces**.
- **No Default Parent**: Unlike classes, interfaces do not extend any parent class by default, making them more flexible.
- **Object Instantiation Restriction**: Objects of an interface **cannot be created**, but **interface references** can be used to hold objects of implementing classes.

#### **2. Example of Interface Usage in Java**

```java
// Define an interface with method declarations
interface Calculator {
    void add(int a, int b);
    void subtract(int a, int b);
}

// Implementing the interface in a class
class MyCalculator implements Calculator {
    @Override
    public void add(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Sum: " + (a + b));
    }
    
    @Override
    public void subtract(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Difference: " + (a - b));
    }
}

// Main class
public class CalculatorApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Interface reference holding an object of implementing class
        Calculator calc = new MyCalculator();
        
        // Calling methods using interface reference
        calc.add(10, 5);
        calc.subtract(10, 5);
        
        // Trying to create an object of interface (Not Allowed)
        // Calculator obj = new Calculator(); // Error: Cannot instantiate an interface
    }
}
```

#### **3. Explanation of the Code**
- **Interface `Calculator`**:
  - Declares `add()` and `subtract()` methods.
  - Methods are **implicitly public and abstract**.
- **Class `MyCalculator`**:
  - Implements `Calculator` interface.
  - Provides concrete implementations for `add()` and `subtract()`.
- **Main Class `CalculatorApp`**:
  - Creates an **interface reference** (`Calculator calc`).
  - Assigns an object of `MyCalculator` to the interface reference.
  - Calls methods using the interface reference.
  - **Demonstrates that an object of an interface cannot be created.**

#### **4. Key Takeaways**
- **Interfaces ensure standardization** by defining method declarations.
- **Multiple inheritance is possible** because a class can implement multiple interfaces.
- **An interface cannot have an object**, but **an interface reference can hold an object of an implementing class**.
- **All methods in an interface are public and abstract by default**.


### **Interface Methods and Variables in Java**

#### **1. Key Properties of Interfaces**
- **All methods in an interface are implicitly `public` and `abstract`**.
- **All variables in an interface are implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`**.
- **Since interface variables are `final`, they must be initialized at the time of declaration**.

#### **2. Example Program: Implementing an Interface**

```java
// Define an interface with method declarations
interface Calculator {
    int A = 10; // Implicitly public, static, and final
    public static final int B = 20; // Explicitly declared public, static, final
    // int C; // Error: Variable 'C' must be initialized
    
    void add(int a, int b);
    void subtract(int a, int b);
    void multiply(int a, int b);
}

// Implementing the interface in a class
class MyCalculator implements Calculator {
    @Override
    public void add(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Sum: " + (a + b));
    }
    
    @Override
    public void subtract(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Difference: " + (a - b));
    }
    
    @Override
    public void multiply(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Product: " + (a * b));
    }
    
    // Attempting to modify a final variable (Will Cause an Error)
    // { A = 99; } // Error: final variable cannot be reassigned
}

// Main class
public class CalculatorApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Accessing interface variables
        System.out.println("Value of A: " + Calculator.A);
        System.out.println("Value of B: " + Calculator.B);
        
        // Creating an object of MyCalculator
        Calculator calc = new MyCalculator();
        
        // Calling methods using interface reference
        calc.add(10, 5);
        calc.subtract(10, 5);
        calc.multiply(10, 5);
    }
}
```

#### **3. Explanation of the Code**
- **Interface `Calculator`**:
  - Declares three methods: `add()`, `subtract()`, and `multiply()`.
  - Defines variables `A` and `B` as `public static final`.
  - `C` is commented out because it would cause an error since interface variables **must be initialized**.
- **Class `MyCalculator`**:
  - Implements the `Calculator` interface.
  - Provides concrete implementations for all three methods.
  - Attempts to modify `A`, which causes an **error** because interface variables are **final**.
- **Main Class `CalculatorApp`**:
  - Accesses interface variables directly using `Calculator.A` and `Calculator.B`.
  - Creates an object of `MyCalculator` using an interface reference.
  - Calls `add()`, `subtract()`, and `multiply()` methods.

#### **4. Key Takeaways**
- **Interface methods are always `public` and `abstract`** (even if not explicitly mentioned).
- **Interface variables are always `public`, `static`, and `final`**.
- **Final variables must be initialized at the time of declaration**.
- **Final variables cannot be reassigned once initialized**.
- **Interfaces provide a contract that implementing classes must follow**.


### **Partial Implementation of an Interface in Java**

#### **1. Key Concept**
- When a class implements an interface, it **must provide implementations** for **all** abstract methods of the interface.
- If a class does **not** provide implementations for all abstract methods, it must be declared as an **abstract class**.
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly.

#### **2. Example Program: Partial Implementation of an Interface**

```java
// Define an interface with method declarations
interface Calculator {
    void add(int a, int b);
    void subtract(int a, int b);
}

// Partial implementation of the interface
abstract class PartialCalculator implements Calculator {
    @Override
    public void add(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Sum: " + (a + b));
    }
    
    // No implementation for subtract(), so the class remains abstract
}

// Full implementation of the interface
class MyCalculator extends PartialCalculator {
    @Override
    public void subtract(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Difference: " + (a - b));
    }
}

// Main class
public class CalculatorApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // PartialCalculator calc = new PartialCalculator(); // Error: Cannot instantiate an abstract class
        Calculator calc = new MyCalculator(); // Using full implementation
        calc.add(10, 5);
        calc.subtract(10, 5);
    }
}
```

#### **3. Explanation of the Code**
- **Interface `Calculator`**:
  - Declares `add()` and `subtract()` methods.
- **Class `PartialCalculator`**:
  - Implements `add()` method.
  - Does **not** provide an implementation for `subtract()`, so it is declared as **abstract**.
  - Cannot be instantiated directly.
- **Class `MyCalculator`**:
  - Extends `PartialCalculator`.
  - Provides implementation for `subtract()`.
- **Main Class `CalculatorApp`**:
  - Cannot create an object of `PartialCalculator` (since it is abstract).
  - Uses `MyCalculator` to access both methods.

#### **4. Key Takeaways**
- A **class must implement all abstract methods** from an interface.
- If a class provides only a **partial implementation**, it must be declared **abstract**.
- Abstract classes **cannot be instantiated**.
- A subclass must implement any remaining abstract methods to become **fully concrete**.


### **Achieving Multiple Inheritance Using Interfaces in Java**

#### **1. Key Concept**
- Java does **not** support multiple inheritance with classes, but it **can be achieved using interfaces**.
- A class can **implement multiple interfaces** and provide implementations for their methods.
- This approach allows Java to achieve **multiple inheritance without ambiguity**.

#### **2. Example Program: Achieving Multiple Inheritance with Interfaces**

```java
// Define first interface
interface Calculator1 {
    void add(int a, int b);
}

// Define second interface
interface Calculator2 {
    void subtract(int a, int b);
}

// Define third interface
interface Calculator3 {
    void multiply(int a, int b);
}

// Implementing multiple interfaces in a single class
class MyCalculator implements Calculator1, Calculator2, Calculator3 {
    @Override
    public void add(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Sum: " + (a + b));
    }
    
    @Override
    public void subtract(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Difference: " + (a - b));
    }
    
    @Override
    public void multiply(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Product: " + (a * b));
    }
}

// Main class
public class CalculatorApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of MyCalculator
        MyCalculator calc = new MyCalculator();
        
        // Calling methods
        calc.add(10, 5);
        calc.subtract(10, 5);
        calc.multiply(10, 5);
    }
}
```

#### **3. Explanation of the Code**
- **Interfaces `Calculator1`, `Calculator2`, and `Calculator3`**:
  - Each interface declares one method (`add()`, `subtract()`, and `multiply()`, respectively).
- **Class `MyCalculator`**:
  - Implements all three interfaces.
  - Provides concrete implementations for all methods.
- **Main Class `CalculatorApp`**:
  - Creates an object of `MyCalculator`.
  - Calls all implemented methods.

#### **4. Key Takeaways**
- **Multiple inheritance is achieved using interfaces**.
- **A class can implement multiple interfaces** and provide concrete implementations.
- **Each interface defines a specific contract that the implementing class must fulfill**.
- **Using interfaces prevents the common issues of multiple inheritance in traditional OOP languages**.



### **Interface Inheritance in Java**

#### **1. Key Concept**
- **An interface cannot implement another interface**, but it **can extend** another interface.
- When an **interface extends another interface**, the child interface inherits all methods of the parent interface.
- If a **class implements the child interface**, it must provide implementations for **all methods of both the child and parent interfaces**.

#### **2. Example Program: Interface Extending Another Interface**

```java
// Parent interface
interface Calculator1 {
    void add(int a, int b);
}

// Child interface extending the parent interface
interface Calculator2 extends Calculator1 {
    void subtract(int a, int b);
}

// Class implementing the child interface
class MyCalculator implements Calculator2 {
    @Override
    public void add(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Sum: " + (a + b));
    }
    
    @Override
    public void subtract(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Difference: " + (a - b));
    }
}

// Main class
public class CalculatorApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of MyCalculator
        MyCalculator calc = new MyCalculator();
        
        // Calling methods
        calc.add(10, 5);
        calc.subtract(10, 5);
    }
}
```

#### **3. Explanation of the Code**
- **Interface `Calculator1`**:
  - Declares `add()` method.
- **Interface `Calculator2`**:
  - **Extends `Calculator1`**, inheriting the `add()` method.
  - Declares an additional `subtract()` method.
- **Class `MyCalculator`**:
  - Implements `Calculator2`, which means it **must provide implementations for both `add()` and `subtract()`**.
- **Main Class `CalculatorApp`**:
  - Creates an object of `MyCalculator` and calls both methods.

#### **4. Key Takeaways**
- **An interface can extend another interface** to inherit its methods.
- **A class implementing a child interface must implement all methods of both child and parent interfaces**.
- **This mechanism supports code reusability and standardization in Java**.


### **Interface Inheritance in Java**

#### **1. Key Concept**
- **An interface cannot implement another interface**, but it **can extend** another interface.
- When an **interface extends another interface**, the child interface inherits all methods of the parent interface.
- If a **class implements the child interface**, it must provide implementations for **all methods of both the child and parent interfaces**.
- **A class can extend another class and implement an interface at the same time.**

#### **2. Example Program: Class Extending Another Class and Implementing an Interface**

```java
// Parent class
class BasicCalculator {
    void multiply(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Product: " + (a * b));
    }
}

// Interface
interface Calculator {
    void add(int a, int b);
}

// Class extending another class and implementing an interface
class AdvancedCalculator extends BasicCalculator implements Calculator {
    public void add(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Sum: " + (a + b));
    }
}

// Main class
public class CalculatorApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AdvancedCalculator calc = new AdvancedCalculator();
        calc.add(10, 5);
        calc.multiply(10, 5);
    }
}
```

#### **3. Key Takeaways**
- **A class can extend another class while also implementing an interface.**
- **This allows the class to inherit concrete methods from the parent class and provide implementations for abstract methods from the interface.**
- **This mechanism supports both inheritance and interface-based abstraction, making the code more flexible and reusable.**



### **Marker (Tag) Interface in Java**

#### **1. Key Concept**
- A **marker interface** (also called a **tag interface**) is an **empty interface** that does not contain any method declarations.
- Marker interfaces are used to signal metadata or specific behavior to the JVM or other classes.
- The **Serializable** interface is a built-in marker interface in Java.

#### **2. Example of a Marker Interface**

```java
// Marker Interface
interface Marker {}

// Class implementing Marker Interface
class SachinTendulkar implements Marker {
    void showPlayer() {
        System.out.println("Sachin Tendulkar is a legendary cricketer.");
    }
}

// Main class
public class MarkerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SachinTendulkar player = new SachinTendulkar();
        if (player instanceof Marker) {
            System.out.println("This class is marked with Marker interface.");
        }
        player.showPlayer();
    }
}
```

#### **3. Key Takeaways**
- **Marker interfaces do not contain any methods.**
- **They are used to indicate that a class belongs to a specific category.**
- **The `instanceof` operator is commonly used to check if an object belongs to a marker interface.**
- **Examples of built-in marker interfaces in Java: `Serializable`, `Cloneable`, `Remote`.**





#### **2. Example Program: Interface with Various Methods**

```java
interface ExampleInterface {
    // Abstract method (public & abstract by default)
    void displayOne();
    
    // Default concrete method
    default void displayTwo() {
        System.out.println("Inside default method displayTwo()");
    }
    
    // Static concrete method
    static void displayThree() {
        System.out.println("Inside static method displayThree()");
    }
    
    // Private concrete method (can only be used inside the interface)
    private void displayFour() {
        System.out.println("Inside private method displayFour()");
    }
}

// Implementing the interface
class MyClass implements ExampleInterface {
    public void displayOne() {
        System.out.println("Implementing abstract method displayOne()");
    }
}

// Main class
public class InterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.displayOne();  // Calling abstract method
        obj.displayTwo();  // Calling default method
        ExampleInterface.displayThree(); // Calling static method
    }
}
```

#### **3. Key Takeaways**
- **Abstract methods must be implemented by the implementing class.**
- **Default methods provide a concrete implementation within the interface.**
- **Static methods can be called using the interface name.**
- **Private methods are only for internal use within the interface.**
