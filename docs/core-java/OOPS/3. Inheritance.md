### **Inheritance in Java**

#### **Definition**
- **Inheritance** is the process of acquiring the **properties and behaviors** of one class into another.
- In Java, inheritance is achieved using the **`extends`** keyword.
- The class that provides properties and behaviors is called the **parent class** (also known as **superclass or base class**).
- The class that inherits properties and behaviors is called the **child class** (also known as **derived class**).

### **Example: Parent-Child Inheritance in Java**

```java
// Parent class
class Parent {
    String eyeColor = "blue";
    
    void foodBusiness() {
        System.out.println("Parent's food business");
    }
}

// Child class inheriting Parent class
class Child extends Parent {
    // Inherits eyeColor and foodBusiness() from Parent
}

// Main class
public class ParentChildApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a Parent object
        Parent p = new Parent();
        System.out.println(p.eyeColor); // Output: blue
        p.foodBusiness(); // Output: Parent's food business

        // Creating a Child object
        Child c = new Child();
        System.out.println(c.eyeColor); // Output: blue (inherited from Parent)
        c.foodBusiness(); // Output: Parent's food business (inherited from Parent)
    }
}
```

### **Output:**
```plaintext
blue
Parent's food business
blue
Parent's food business
```

### **Why is Inheritance Known as an "IS-A" Relationship?**
- Inheritance in Java represents an **IS-A relationship**, meaning that the child class **is a** type of the parent class.
- This concept aligns with real-world scenarios:
  - **A child is a person** (Child inherits properties from Person).
  - **A dog is an animal** (Dog inherits properties from Animal).
  - **A car is a vehicle** (Car inherits properties from Vehicle).
- In our example:
  - **Child IS-A Parent**, so it inherits the properties (`eyeColor`) and behaviors (`foodBusiness()`).

---

### **Key Points:**
- **The `Child` class extends the `Parent` class**, meaning it automatically inherits properties and methods.
- **`Child` objects can access `eyeColor` and `foodBusiness()` from `Parent` without redefining them**.
- **Java supports single inheritance**, meaning a class can extend only one other class.
- The `extends` keyword is used for implementing inheritance.

Inheritance promotes **code reusability** and a **hierarchical class structure**, making programs easier to manage and extend!


### **Inheritance in Java**

#### **Definition**
- **Inheritance** is the process of acquiring the **properties and behaviors** of one class into another.
- In Java, inheritance is achieved using the **`extends`** keyword.
- The class that provides properties and behaviors is called the **parent class** (also known as **superclass or base class**).
- The class that inherits properties and behaviors is called the **child class** (also known as **derived class**).

---

### **Types of Inheritance in Java**

#### **1. Single-Level Inheritance**
- A **single parent class** is inherited by **one child class**.

```java
// Parent class
class Parent {
    String eyeColor = "blue";
    void foodBusiness() {
        System.out.println("Parent's food business");
    }
}

// Child class inheriting Parent class
class Child extends Parent {
    // Inherits eyeColor and foodBusiness() from Parent
}
```

#### **2. Multi-Level Inheritance**
- A **class inherits from a parent class**, and then **another class inherits from that child class**.
- This forms a chain of inheritance.

```java
// Grandparent class
class GrandParent {
    void familyTradition() {
        System.out.println("Following family traditions");
    }
}

// Parent class inheriting GrandParent
class Parent extends GrandParent {
    void business() {
        System.out.println("Running family business");
    }
}

// Child class inheriting Parent
class Child extends Parent {
    void play() {
        System.out.println("Child is playing");
    }
}
```

### **3. Hierarchical Inheritance**
- A **single parent class** is inherited by **multiple child classes**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be48bf46-cfee-442c-9276-7799821e324f)

```java
// Parent class
class Parent {
    void property() {
        System.out.println("Parent's property");
    }
}

// Child class 1
class Child1 extends Parent {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Child1 using parent's property");
    }
}

// Child class 2
class Child2 extends Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Child2 using parent's property");
    }
}
```

### **4. Hybrid Inheritance**
- **Hybrid inheritance** is a combination of **Single-Level, Multi-Level, and Hierarchical Inheritance**.
- Java does **not support multiple inheritance** with classes to avoid ambiguity, but hybrid inheritance can be achieved using interfaces.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a60c0059-afa7-4e89-a752-c04e799aca26)


```java
// Parent class
class Parent {
    void property() {
        System.out.println("Parent's property");
    }
}

// Intermediate class (Multi-Level Inheritance)
class Intermediate extends Parent {
    void business() {
        System.out.println("Intermediate class running business");
    }
}

// Interface (to simulate multiple inheritance)
interface ExtraFeatures {
    void extra();
}

// Child class inheriting from Intermediate and implementing ExtraFeatures interface
class Child extends Intermediate implements ExtraFeatures {
    public void extra() {
        System.out.println("Child has extra features");
    }
}
```




---

### **5. Multiple Inheritance (Not Allowed with Classes, Achieved Using Interfaces)**
- **Multiple inheritance means a child class inherits from more than one parent class.**
- **Java does NOT support multiple inheritance with classes** to prevent conflicts and the **diamond problem**.
- **Why is it not allowed?**
  - In Java, every class automatically extends the `Object` class.
  - If multiple classes are inherited, the compiler would get confused about which method to execute (diamond problem).
  - To avoid this, **Java restricts multiple inheritance with classes** but allows it with **interfaces**.

## Classes

## Interfaces
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cd67192-42cd-4af6-b211-da7980f70103)



#### **Example of Diamond Problem in Multiple Inheritance (NOT ALLOWED)**
```java
class A {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Class A");
    }
}

class B {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Class B");
    }
}

// Class C trying to inherit from both A and B (NOT ALLOWED in Java)
class C extends A, B { // ERROR: Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes
    
}
```

#### **Solution: Achieving Multiple Inheritance Using Interfaces**
- Java allows **multiple inheritance using interfaces** because interfaces only provide method declarations, not implementations.
- This removes ambiguity and avoids the **diamond problem**.

```java
interface A {
    void show();
}

interface B {
    void display();
}

// Class C implementing both interfaces (Allowed in Java)
class C implements A, B {
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Implementing show method from Interface A");
    }
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Implementing display method from Interface B");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C obj = new C();
        obj.show();    // Output: Implementing show method from Interface A
        obj.display(); // Output: Implementing display method from Interface B
    }
}
```

### **5. Cyclic Inheritance - not allowed in java

### **Why is Inheritance Known as an "IS-A" Relationship?**
- Inheritance in Java represents an **IS-A relationship**, meaning that the child class **is a** type of the parent class.
- This concept aligns with real-world scenarios:
  - **A child is a person** (Child inherits properties from Person).
  - **A dog is an animal** (Dog inherits properties from Animal).
  - **A car is a vehicle** (Car inherits properties from Vehicle).
- In our example:
  - **Child IS-A Parent**, so it inherits the properties (`eyeColor`) and behaviors (`foodBusiness()`).
  - **Parent IS-A GrandParent**, so it inherits behaviors (`familyTradition()`).

---

### **Key Points:**
- **The `Child` class extends the `Parent` class**, meaning it automatically inherits properties and methods.
- **Multi-level and hierarchical inheritance allow structured hierarchy but should be used carefully to avoid complexity**.
- **Hybrid inheritance is a mix of different types of inheritance and is typically implemented using interfaces in Java**.
- **Java does NOT support multiple inheritance (one class inheriting from multiple classes) directly**, but hybrid inheritance can be achieved using interfaces.
- The `extends` keyword is used for implementing inheritance.

### **Why is Multiple Inheritance Not Allowed in Java?**
- To avoid the **diamond problem** (ambiguity due to multiple inheritance with classes).
- To ensure code **maintainability and simplicity**.
- Java encourages using **interfaces** to achieve multiple inheritance in a **controlled and conflict-free manner**.

Inheritance promotes **code reusability** and a **hierarchical class structure**, making programs easier to manage and extend!

### **Types of Methods in Inheritance**

When a class inherits another class, it can access different types of methods. These methods are classified as follows:

---

### **1. Inherited Methods**
- These are methods **inherited** from the parent class to the child class.
- The child class uses these methods **without modifying** them.

#### **Example:**
```java
class Parent {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("This is a parent method.");
    }
}
class Child extends Parent {
    // No modification of the method
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.show(); // Output: This is a parent method.
    }
}
```

---

### **2. Overridden Methods**
- These methods are inherited from the parent class, **but modified** in the child class.
- Method overriding is done by redefining the method with the **same signature** in the child class.

#### **Example:**
```java
class Parent {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("This is a parent method.");
    }
}
class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void show() { // Overriding method
        System.out.println("This is an overridden method in Child class.");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.show(); // Output: This is an overridden method in Child class.
    }
}
```

---

### **3. Child-Specific Methods**
- These methods exist **only in the child class** and are **not inherited** from the parent class.

#### **Example:**
```java
class Parent {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("This is a parent method.");
    }
}
class Child extends Parent {
    void play() { // Child-specific method
        System.out.println("Child is playing.");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.show(); // Output: This is a parent method.
        obj.play(); // Output: Child is playing.
    }
}
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c12b2fdd-f296-4b08-bdda-d231ef6ff42b)


---

### **Summary:**
- **Inherited Methods**: Used without modification.
- **Overridden Methods**: Modified in the child class.
- **Child-Specific Methods**: Exclusive to the child class and not present in the parent class.

This understanding of method types in inheritance helps in structuring Java programs efficiently.


### **Execution of Constructor in Inheritance**

Constructors play a crucial role in inheritance by managing the object initialization process. Below are key concepts related to constructor execution in inheritance:

---

### **1. Execution Order of Constructors**
- In Java, when a child class object is created, the **parent class constructor** is executed first, followed by the child class constructor.
- This ensures that all **parent class properties** are initialized before the child class properties.

#### **Example:**
```java
class Parent {
    Parent() {
        System.out.println("Parent constructor executed");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    Child() {
        System.out.println("Child constructor executed");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Parent constructor executed
Child constructor executed
```

---

### **2. Role of `super()` in Constructor Execution**
- The `super()` method is used inside a **child class constructor** to explicitly call the **parent class constructor**.
- If `super()` is not written explicitly, Java **implicitly calls the parent class's zero-parameter constructor**.

#### **Example:**
```java
class Parent {
    Parent(String message) {
        System.out.println("Parent constructor: " + message);
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    Child() {
        super("Hello from Parent"); // Calling parent constructor
        System.out.println("Child constructor executed");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Parent constructor: Hello from Parent
Child constructor executed
```

---

### **3. Default Parent Class - `Object` Class**
- If a class does **not explicitly extend any other class**, it automatically extends the **`Object` class**.
- The `Object` class is the top-most class in Java and provides basic functionalities like `toString()`, `hashCode()`, and `equals()`.

#### **Example:**
```java
class MyClass {
    // Implicitly extends Object class
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        System.out.println(obj.toString()); // Method from Object class
    }
}
```

---

### **4. Constructor Chaining**
- **Constructor chaining** refers to the process of calling **one constructor from another**.
- It helps in reusing constructor logic to **avoid code duplication**.

#### **Example:**
```java
class Student {
    int roll;
    String name;
    
    Student() {
        this(101, "Default Name"); // Calling another constructor in the same class
        System.out.println("Default Constructor Called");
    }
    
    Student(int r, String n) {
        roll = r;
        name = n;
        System.out.println("Parameterized Constructor Called");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student();
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Parameterized Constructor Called
Default Constructor Called
```

```
class Object{

}
class Parent extends Object{
    void dispParent(){
        System.out.println("Parent class method");
    }
    Parent(){
        super();
    }
}
class Child extends Parent{
    void dispChild(){
        System.out.println("Child class method");
    }
    Child(){
        super();
    }
}
public class ParentChildApp extends Object{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent parent = new Parent();
        parent.dispParent(); // Calling method from Parent class
        Child child = new Child();
        child.dispParent(); // Calling method from Parent class
        child.dispChild();  // Calling method from Child class
    }
    ParentChildApp(){
        super();
    }
    // Constructor of ParentChildApp class
}

```

```
class Object{

}
class Vehicle extends Object{
    String color;
    Vehicle(){
        super();
    }
    Vehicle(String color){
        this();
        this.color = color;
    }
}
class Car extends Vehicle{
    String brand;
    Car(){
        this("Kia");
    }
    Car(String brand){
        super("Black");
        this.brand = brand;
    }
}

public class VehicleApp{
   public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car c1 = new Car();
        System.out.println(c1.color + " " + c1.brand); // Black Kia
        Car c2 = new Car();
        System.out.println(c2.color + " " + c2.brand); // Black Kia
   }
}
```


---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Constructors in inheritance execute in order from parent to child.**
- **`super()` is used to call the parent class constructor explicitly.**
- **If a class does not extend any other class, it extends the `Object` class by default.**
- **Constructor chaining allows reusing constructor logic within the same class.**

Understanding these concepts ensures smooth object initialization and proper execution flow in Java inheritance.


### **Method Overriding and Variable Shadowing in Java**

Method overriding and variable shadowing are important concepts in Java's **inheritance mechanism**. They help define how methods and variables are accessed and modified in a class hierarchy.

---

### **1. Method Overriding (`@Override` Annotation)**
- **Method Overriding** occurs when a **child class provides a specific implementation** for a method already defined in the parent class.
- The method in the child class must have the **same method signature** as in the parent class.
- The `@Override` annotation helps the compiler verify that a method is correctly overriding a parent method.

#### **Example:**
```java
class Parent {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("This is Parent's show method.");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void show() { // Overriding the show method
        System.out.println("This is Child's show method.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.show(); // Output: This is Child's show method.
    }
}
```

---

### **2. Variable Shadowing**
- **Variable shadowing** occurs when a variable in the child class has the **same name** as a variable in the parent class.
- The child class variable **hides** the parent class variable.
- The `super` keyword is used to access the **parent class variable**.

#### **Example:**
```java
class Parent {
    int num = 10;
}

class Child extends Parent {
    int num = 20; // Shadowing Parent's variable
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Child num: " + num); // Refers to Child's num
        System.out.println("Parent num: " + super.num); // Refers to Parent's num
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.display();
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Child num: 20
Parent num: 10
```

---

### **3. `this` Keyword**
- `this` is used to **refer to the current instance of the class**.
- It helps to remove **variable shadowing** when local variables have the same name as instance variables.

#### **Example:**
```java
class Example {
    int value;
    
    Example(int value) {
        this.value = value; // `this` differentiates between local and instance variable
    }
    
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Value: " + value);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Example(50);
        obj.show(); // Output: Value: 50
    }
}
```

---

### **4. `super` Keyword**
- `super` is used to **access parent class members (variables, methods, and constructors)**.
- **Access Parent Class Variable:**
  ```java
  super.variableName;
  ```
- **Call Parent Class Method:**
  ```java
  super.methodName();
  ```
- **Invoke Parent Class Constructor:**
  ```java
  super();
  ```

#### **Example:**
```java
class Parent {
    Parent() {
        System.out.println("Parent Constructor");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    Child() {
        super(); // Calls Parent's constructor
        System.out.println("Child Constructor");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Parent Constructor
Child Constructor
```

---

### **5. Constructor Chaining**
- **Constructor chaining** allows a constructor to call another constructor **within the same class**.
- This is done using the `this()` method.

#### **Example:**
```java
class Example {
    Example() {
        this(100); // Calls the parameterized constructor
        System.out.println("Default Constructor");
    }
    
    Example(int x) {
        System.out.println("Parameterized Constructor: " + x);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Example();
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Parameterized Constructor: 100
Default Constructor
```

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Method Overriding** allows a child class to modify a method from the parent class.
- **Variable Shadowing** occurs when a child class has a variable with the same name as in the parent class.
- **The `this` keyword** is used for differentiating between instance and local variables.
- **The `super` keyword** is used for accessing parent class members and constructors.
- **Constructor Chaining** enables calling one constructor from another inside the same class using `this()`. 

Understanding these concepts helps in writing efficient and maintainable Java programs.

### **Accessing Variables in Inheritance using `super` and `super.super`**

#### **Understanding `super` and why `super.super.a` gives an error**

In Java, `super` is used to access members (variables and methods) of the immediate parent class. However, Java does **not** allow `super.super.a` to directly access a grandparent’s variable because Java enforces encapsulation and does not provide direct access to the grandparent's class.

---

### **1. Accessing Immediate Parent’s Variable using `super.a`**
```java
// Parent class
class Parent {
    int a = 50; // Parent's variable
}

// Child class
class Child extends Parent {
    int a = 25; // Child's variable

    void displayValues() {
        System.out.println("Child's a: " + a); // Refers to Child’s a
        System.out.println("Parent's a: " + super.a); // Refers to Parent’s a
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.displayValues();
    }
}
```

#### **Output:**
```
Child's a: 25
Parent's a: 50
```

#### **Explanation:**
- `a` in `Child` refers to its own variable.
- `super.a` accesses the parent class’s `a`.

---

### **2. Why `super.super.a` Gives an Error?**
Java does **not** allow `super.super.a` because `super` itself refers to the immediate parent, and there is no way to directly access the grandparent's variable from the child class. Instead, we use an **intermediate method in the parent class** to access the grandparent's variable.

#### **Alternative Approach to Access Grandparent’s Variable**
```java
// Grandparent class
class Grandparent {
    int a = 100; // Grandparent's variable
}

// Parent class
class Parent extends Grandparent {
    int a = 50; // Parent's variable

    // Method to return grandparent's 'a'
    int getGrandparentA() {
        return super.a; // Accessing Grandparent's variable
    }
}

// Child class
class Child extends Parent {
    int a = 25; // Child's variable

    void displayValues() {
        System.out.println("Child's a: " + a);
        System.out.println("Parent's a: " + super.a);
        System.out.println("Grandparent's a: " + getGrandparentA()); // Indirect access to Grandparent’s a
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.displayValues();
    }
}
```

#### **Output:**
```
Child's a: 25
Parent's a: 50
Grandparent's a: 100
```

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
1. `super.a` allows access to the **immediate parent’s** variable.
2. `super.super.a` is **not allowed** in Java.
3. To access a **grandparent’s variable**, use an **intermediate method in the parent class** (`getGrandparentA()`).

This ensures proper encapsulation and controlled access to inherited variables in Java.

### **Final Keyword in Java**

The `final` keyword in Java is used to restrict modification in different ways:

1. **Final Class** - Prevents inheritance.
2. **Final Method** - Prevents method overriding.
3. **Final Variable** - Creates constants (unchangeable values).

---

### **1. Final Class (Prevents Inheritance)**
```java
final class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("This is a final class");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent { // Error: Cannot inherit from a final class
}
```

#### **Error:**
```
Error: Cannot inherit from final class 'Parent'
```

---

### **2. Final Method (Prevents Method Overriding)**
```java
class Parent {
    final void show() {
        System.out.println("This is a final method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void show() { // Error: Cannot override final method
        System.out.println("Trying to override final method");
    }
}
```

#### **Error:**
```
Error: show() in Child cannot override show() in Parent; overridden method is final
```

---

### **3. Final Variable (Creates Constants)**
```java
class Test {
    final int VALUE = 10;
    void changeValue() {
        VALUE = 20; // Error: Cannot assign a value to final variable 'VALUE'
    }
}
```

#### **Error:**
```
Error: cannot assign a value to final variable 'VALUE'
```

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Final Class:** Prevents inheritance.
- **Final Method:** Prevents method overriding.
- **Final Variable:** Creates constants that cannot be modified.

This ensures security, controlled access, and immutability in Java.

### **Access Modifiers in Java**

Access modifiers in Java define the **scope** and **visibility** of a class, method, or variable. Java provides four types of access modifiers:

1. **Public** - Accessible anywhere in the program.
2. **Protected** - Accessible within the same package and by child classes in different packages (via inheritance).
3. **Default (No Modifier)** - Accessible only within the same package.
4. **Private** - Accessible only within the same class.

---

### **1. Public Access Modifier**
- Methods and variables declared as `public` can be accessed **from anywhere** in the program.

#### **Example:**
```java
public class Example {
    public int data = 10;
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Public Access Modifier");
    }
}

class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Example();
        System.out.println(obj.data); // Accessible
        obj.display(); // Accessible
    }
}
```

---

### **2. Protected Access Modifier**
- Accessible **within the same package** and **inherited** by child classes of different packages.

#### **Example:**
```java
package mypackage;
class Parent {
    protected void show() {
        System.out.println("Protected Access Modifier");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.show(); // Accessible through inheritance
    }
}
```

---

### **3. Default (No Modifier) Access Modifier**
- If no access modifier is specified, it is **accessible only within the same package**.

#### **Example:**
```java
class Example {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Default Access Modifier");
    }
}

class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Example();
        obj.display(); // Accessible (same package)
    }
}
```

---

### **4. Private Access Modifier**
- Accessible **only within the same class**.

#### **Example:**
```java
class Example {
    private int data = 20;
    private void display() {
        System.out.println("Private Access Modifier");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Example();
        System.out.println(obj.data); // Accessible (same class)
        obj.display(); // Accessible (same class)
    }
}
```

#### **Error:**
```java
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Example();
        System.out.println(obj.data); // Error: data has private access
        obj.display(); // Error: display() has private access
    }
}
```

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
| Modifier    | Same Class | Same Package | Child Class (Different Package) | Outside Package |
|------------|------------|--------------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| **Public** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Protected** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (via inheritance) | ❌ No |
| **Default** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Private** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

This helps in **controlling access** to data and ensures **better security and encapsulation** in Java.



### **Access Modifiers in Java with Packages**

#### **Program 1 (P1/Program1.java)**
```java
package P1;

public class Program1 {
    public int a = 10;
    protected int b = 20;
    int c = 30; // Default access modifier
    private int d = 40;

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("a: " + a);
        System.out.println("b: " + b);
        System.out.println("c: " + c);
        System.out.println("d: " + d);
    }
}
```

---

#### **Program 2 (P1/Program2.java) - Extending Program1**
```java
package P1;

public class Program2 extends Program1 {
    public void display2() {
        System.out.println("a: " + a); // Accessible (public)
        System.out.println("b: " + b); // Accessible (protected)
        System.out.println("c: " + c); // Accessible (default, same package)
        // System.out.println("d: " + d); // Error: d is private
    }
}
```

---

#### **Program 3 (P1/Program3.java) - Accessing Program1 without Inheritance**
```java
package P1;

public class Program3 {
    public void display3() {
        Program1 p1 = new Program1();
        System.out.println("a: " + p1.a); // Accessible (public)
        System.out.println("b: " + p1.b); // Accessible (protected, same package)
        System.out.println("c: " + p1.c); // Accessible (default, same package)
        // System.out.println("d: " + p1.d); // Error: d is private
    }
}
```

---

#### **Program 4 (P2/Program4.java) - Extending Program1 in a different package**
```java
package P2;
import P1.Program1;

public class Program4 extends Program1 {
    public void display4() {
        System.out.println("a: " + a); // Accessible (public)
        System.out.println("b: " + b); // Accessible (protected, via inheritance)
        // System.out.println("c: " + c); // Error: Default not accessible outside package
        // System.out.println("d: " + d); // Error: Private not accessible
    }
}
```

---

#### **Program 5 (P2/Program5.java) - Accessing Program1 without Inheritance**
```java
package P2;
import P1.Program1;

public class Program5 {
    public void display5() {
        Program1 p1 = new Program1();
        System.out.println("a: " + p1.a); // Accessible (public)
        // System.out.println("b: " + p1.b); // Error: Protected not accessible without inheritance
        // System.out.println("c: " + p1.c); // Error: Default not accessible outside package
        // System.out.println("d: " + p1.d); // Error: Private not accessible
    }
}
```

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Public (`a`)**: Accessible everywhere.
- **Protected (`b`)**: Accessible within the same package and in subclasses in different packages.
- **Default (`c`)**: Accessible within the same package only.
- **Private (`d`)**: Accessible only within the same class.

🔹 **Errors occur** when trying to access `protected`, `default`, or `private` members outside their scope. 🚀
